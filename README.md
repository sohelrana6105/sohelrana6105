Hi, This is Sohel  a web developer who loves creating websites that are both useful and easy to use. With a background in Information and communication of technology, I focus on building responsive websites and web apps that work well on any device. I work with tools like JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind Css, Bootstarp, Firebase, github, HTML, CSS3, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and always learn new skills to keep up with the latest trends. I enjoy solving problems, designing simple and clear user interfaces, and turning creative ideas into reality. In my free time, I like playing, walking on noise free road, my large campus, village road, forest, etc. . Iâ€™m excited to work on projects that make a difference and would love to help bring your ideas to life!
